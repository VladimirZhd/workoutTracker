# Overview

Workout tracker is an app that keeps track of your workouts. It built for iOS only so you need to have an iPhone to use it. It will be availiabe at app store as soon as I finish it. 

I wanted to build this app for myself because I couldn't find anyhting that fits my needs and is free. Also, I really wanted to learn more about SwiftUI and iOS development.

# Development Environment

I've used Xcode and MacBook Pro to use iPhone simulator.
Everything is done with Swift and SwiftUI views. I've added firebase to the project but haven't started the implementation yet.
